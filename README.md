MycoStackâ„¢ is a regenerative retrofit system for oil &amp; gas infrastructure using engineered mycelium to filter emissions, degrade toxins, and restore soil. It transforms flare stacks, waste zones, and pipelines into living carbon-negative ecosystems, enabling fossil industries to become net-negative emitters.
